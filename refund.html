  <h1>Refund Policy</h1>

  <p>
    At <strong>Cheta Med</strong>, we work hard to provide reliable, helpful, and accurate medical-related content and services. 
    Most of the resources on our website are free, but in case we introduce any paid subscriptions, courses, or digital downloads, 
    this refund policy will apply to those transactions.
  </p>

  <p>We understand that situations may arise where a refund is required. Refunds may be approved under the following conditions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If you were charged more than once for the same product or service due to a technical error.</li>
    <li>If you made a payment but were unable to access the purchased product or service because of a verified system issue on our end.</li>
    <li>If you cancel your subscription within the refund eligibility period (clearly stated at the time of purchase).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Please note: Refunds cannot be issued for services already used in full, downloadable materials once delivered, 
    or issues beyond our control such as internet connectivity problems or third-party platform errors. 
    To request a refund, please email us at 
    <a href="mailto:medsera48@gmail.com">medsera48@gmail.com</a> with your payment details and reason for the request.
  </p>

  <p>
    Once your request is received, we will review it and update you within 5–7 business days. 
    Approved refunds will be processed to your original payment method.
  </p>

  <p>
    Cheta Med reserves the right to modify this policy at any time. We recommend checking this page periodically for updates.
