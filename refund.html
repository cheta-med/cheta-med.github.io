  <h1>Refund Policy</h1>

  <p>
    At <strong>Cheta Med</strong>, we value our users and strive to provide the best possible services and information. 
    Since our website primarily offers free medical-related content, most sections of our platform are not eligible for monetary refunds. 
    However, in the event of any paid subscription, service, or digital product offered in the future, the following refund policy will apply.
  </p>

  <p>Refunds will only be processed under the following conditions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If you have been charged more than once for the same service.</li>
    <li>If a technical error prevents you from accessing a paid feature or digital product after successful payment.</li>
    <li>If cancellation is requested within the specified refund window mentioned at the time of purchase.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Please note that refunds are not applicable for services already availed, downloadable products once delivered, or delays/issues beyond our control 
    (such as internet failures or third-party platform errors). All refund requests must be submitted through our official contact email 
    <a href="mailto:medsera48@gmail.com">medsera48@gmail.com</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Cheta Med reserves the right to modify or update this refund policy at any time without prior notice. 
    Users are encouraged to review this page regularly for the latest updates.
