  <h1>About Us</h1>

  <div class="about">
    <p>
      Welcome to <strong>Cheta Med</strong> – your trusted source for simplified medical and health-related information. We understand that healthcare and medicine can sometimes feel complicated, filled with technical words and confusing explanations. Our mission is to bridge that gap by providing clear, accurate, and easy-to-understand content for everyone.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      At Cheta Med, our primary goal is to make reliable health and medical information accessible to people everywhere. We believe that awareness is the first step towards better health. Whether you are a student, a healthcare enthusiast, or someone simply curious about medicines, our articles are designed to help you understand the basics without feeling overwhelmed.
    </p>

    <h2>What We Do</h2>
    <p>
      We publish detailed guides, articles, and explanations about medicines, treatments, healthcare systems, and wellness tips. All our content is created with the intention of educating readers in simple language. We also keep our information updated to reflect the latest knowledge available in the medical field.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our website is not a replacement for a doctor’s advice. Instead, it acts as a supportive learning platform for people who want to know more before they consult a healthcare professional. We take great care in presenting information responsibly, with disclaimers where necessary, so our readers know when to seek professional help.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Trust Us?</h2>
    <p>
      In today’s digital age, misinformation spreads quickly. At Cheta Med, we value accuracy and reliability. We put effort into cross-checking sources and providing references where possible. Our aim is to become a platform that people can rely on when searching for basic health knowledge online. Transparency is one of our core principles – we openly state that while we strive to be accurate, we are not a substitute for certified medical professionals.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <p>
      Looking ahead, Cheta Med aspires to grow into a community-driven platform where readers can learn, share, and engage with healthcare information. We hope to add more resources, including infographics, FAQs, and simple explainer videos, to make learning about medicine even easier. Our long-term vision is to empower people with knowledge so they can take better decisions about their health.
    </p>
